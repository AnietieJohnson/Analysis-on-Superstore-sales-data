## Introduction
As we stand at the threshold of a new business year, the path forward demands a keen understanding of sales performance from the preceding year. To navigate this journey effectively and make informed decisions, we embark on a data analysis project that will unearth valuable insights. By scrutinizing specific segments, quarters, months, products, and cities, we seek to pinpoint areas of significance. This project's ultimate goal is to equip us with the strategic insight required to enhance performance and elevate decision-making in the year ahead.

I used Pivot Table and charts to better explain my insights for each  question.
- I created the pivot table by Selecting the data range
- Then from the **_Insert tab_** I chose PivotTable and set it to new worksheet.
- Chose a fitting field for Rows field and for Values Field
- For charts, I created each by using **_pivot table analyze_**
- Column chart that gave the best representation.
