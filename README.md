## Introduction
As we stand at the threshold of a new business year, the path forward demands a keen understanding of our company's sales performance from the preceding year. To navigate this journey effectively and make informed decisions, we embark on a data analysis project that will unearth valuable insights. By scrutinizing specific segments, quarters, months, products, and cities, we seek to pinpoint areas of significance. This project's ultimate goal is to equip us with the strategic insight required to enhance performance and elevate decision-making in the year ahead.

## Solutions
### Question 1:
- To get **_total sales_** for the year, I applied the **SUM FUNCTION** i.e =SUM(T2:T9995) to sum up the entire Sales column.
Superstore sold a total of **$ 2,297,201** worth of product for the year
![](https://github.com/AnietieJohnson/Analysis-on-Superstore-sales-data/blob/main/total%20sales.png)

- To get **_total Profit_** for the year, I applied the **SUM FUNCTION** i.e =SUM(W2:W9995) to sum up the entire Profit column.
Super store made a profit of **$ 286,397** for the year

- To get **_total Discount_** for the year, I applied the **SUM FUNCTION** i.e =SUM(V2:V9995) to sum up the entire Discount column.
  Super store gave a total discount of **$ 1,561** in the year.

### Question 2:
- To get **_Average sales_** for the year, I applied the **AVERAGE FUNCTION** i.e =AVERAGE(T2:T9995), this takes the average of total values in the sales column.
On average superstore was selling atleast **$ 229.86** worth of product daily

- To get **_Average Profit_** for the year, I applied the **AVERAGE FUNCTION** i.e =AVERAGE(W2:W9995), this takes the average of total values in the Profit column.
On average superstore Made a profit of atleast **$ 28.66** on sales made daily

### Question 3:
- To get **_Highest sale_** within the year, I applied the **MAX FUNCTION** i.e =Max(T2:T9995), this function looks through the Sales column and returns the highest value sold. **$ 22,638** returned as the  highest sale value within the year.
![](https://github.com/AnietieJohnson/Analysis-on-Superstore-sales-data/blob/main/Highest%20sales%20value.png)

-  To get **_Highest Profit_** within the year, I applied the **MAX FUNCTION** i.e =Max(W2:W9995), this function looks through the Profit column and returns the highest profit value. **$8,400** returned has the highest profit value made within the year

### Question 4:
#### Product, City and Month that generated the highest Sale value within the year.
- To locate the **_product_** that gave the highest sale, I used **LOOKUP FUNCTION, (VLOOKUP)** I.E =VLOOKUP($AB$7,$E$2:$S$9995,15,0), it searches for a value in the leftmost column of a table and returns a related value from a specified column. 
Vlookup looks from left to right, so I repositioned my sales column, placed it on the left end of the product, city and month column before applying the formular. This means _Cisco TelePresence System EX90 Videoconferencing Unit_ was sold at $22,638 and it is the product that sold at the highest rate in the year.

- To locate the **_City_** that that gave the highest sale, I used **LOOKUP FUNCTION, (VLOOKUP)** I.E =VLOOKUP($AB$7,$E$2:$S$9995,8,0)
![](https://github.com/AnietieJohnson/Analysis-on-Superstore-sales-data/blob/main/City%20that%20generated%20the%20highest%20sale%20value.png)

- To locate the **_Month_** that that gave the highest sale, I used **LOOKUP FUNCTION, (VLOOKUP)** I.E =VLOOKUP($AB$7,E2:Y9995,21,0)
![](https://github.com/AnietieJohnson/Analysis-on-Superstore-sales-data/blob/main/Month%20with%20the%20highest%20sale%20value.png)

#### Product, City and Month that generated the highest Profit value within the year.
- To locate the **_product_** that gave the highest Profit, I used **LOOKUP FUNCTION, (VLOOKUP)** I.E =VLOOKUP($AB$7,$E$2:$S$9995,15,0), it searches for a value in the leftmost column of a table and returns a related value from a specified column. 
Vlookup looks from left to right, so I repositioned my Profit column, placed it on the left end of the product, city and month column column before applying the formular. _Canon imageCLASS 2200 Advanced Copier_ generated  $8,400 as profit, it is the product that generated highest profit within the year.
