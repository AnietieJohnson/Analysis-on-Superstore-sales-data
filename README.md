# PROJECT 1
## Introduction
As we stand at the threshold of a new business year, the path forward demands a keen understanding of our company's sales performance from the preceding year. To navigate this journey effectively and make informed decisions, we embark on a data analysis project that will unearth valuable insights. By scrutinizing specific segments, quarters, months, products, and countries, we seek to pinpoint areas of significance that warrant heightened attention. This project's ultimate goal is to equip us with the strategic foresight required to enhance performance and elevate decision-making in the year ahead.
